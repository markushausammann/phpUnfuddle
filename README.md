phpUnfuddle
===========

phpUnfuddle was supposed to be a PHP wrapper for the RESTful unfuddle API. 
So far only ticket posting is implemented because that's what we needed. :)

Would be nice to extend this library but we're not sure how long we're going to use unfuddle.

This library should start using Guzzle as a curl wrapper.
